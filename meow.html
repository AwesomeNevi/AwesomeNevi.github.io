                <h3>Arduino Sonar</h3>
                <p>Correcting for speed of sound based off of measured temperature and humidity allowed me to obtain a more accurate reading</p>
                <p>Additionally, I learnt about precise timing functions such as micros() and millis() to handle timing for sending and receiving ultrasonic pulses</p>
                <p>This discovery also introduced me to how these functions can be used to achieve multitasking capabilities on microcontrollers</p>
                <p>The HC-SR04 module uses ultrasonic transducers and how piezoelectric crystals to send/receive pulses</p>
                <p>I was able to learn about more practical uses of the piezoelectric effect, as well as how mechanical deformation results in current flows on an atomic level</p>

                <h3>Bluetooth messaging</h3>
                <p>Using Arduino and HC-05 module to send messages between the serial monitor and a mobile device</p>
                <p>This project was upgraded to use a mini OLED display (operating on i2C) to display messages</p>
                <p>Using the bluetooth modules taught me about the functioning of these devices and the different protocols in use</p>
                <p>I explored Bluetooth Core Specification including Link Layer Protocol and L2CAP, which facilitate connection</p>
                <p>I also learnt about the transmission protocol, specifically how Gaussian Filtering (GFSK) is used to reduce interference</p>
                <p>Learning about the transmission process showed me how amplification, signal conditioning and modulation and all used in conjunction</p>
                <p>Working with the OLED display introduced me to the I  C serial bus</p>
                <p>This taught me about device addressing and how to use the multi-master multi-slave model to interface multiple devices</p>

                <h3>Object avoiding car</h3>
                <p>This project combined all the aspects of electronics and circuits I had learnt at the time</p>
                <p>It taught me about voltage amplification with ICs , how to control devices with larger requirements from small outputs on micrcontrollers</p>
                <p>Initially I learnt how to construct an H-bridge to control a motor’s direction</p>
                <p>Using the L2893D IC then eventually the shield also taught me about pulse-width modulation (PWM) and it’s functions in speed control</p>
                <p>I explored the mathematical relations between duty cycle and frequency to calculate power delivery to the motors by PWM.</p>
                <p>Used effective programming techniques such as interrupts to build an event driven model to conserve power</p>
                <p>This project taught me to always consider physical factors such as motor response and power management when putting my knowledge into practice</p>
                <p>Additionally the motor shield introduced me to different motors such as steppers and how to initiate finer control with phases and microstepping</p>

                <h3>Bluetooth car</h3>
                <p>Expanded on the previous project to learn about signal decoding.</p>
                <p>I learnt how decoding works when a byte stream is given to the microcontroller</p>
                <p>This also introduced me to MIT App Inventor as well as other tools to develop interfaces for my projects</p>
                <p>Learning about signal decoding taught me how to parse more complex command structures from a single set in a stream</p>
                <p>Configuring the bluetooth modules with AT command protocol helped ensure reliability and safety. This helped me learn about communicating with devices on the hardware level</p>

                <h3>RC Car</h3>
                <p>First project communicating between two Arduino devices</p>
                <p>Using the NRF2L01 taught me how to work with the ISM 2.4 GHz band and interface with the SPI bus</p>
                <p>This offered many advantages over HC-05 including frequency selection, higher bandwidth and higher data rate</p>
                <p>It also featured six data pipes allowing for better multi-device configurations (1:6 star) if necessary</p>
                <p>Exploring this funcionality helped me learn about network topologies and arranging devices in a network  </p>
                <p>It also showed me how data packets are sent (padding and dynamic payload length).</p>
                <p>Learning about the transmission process showed me how to adjust these properties to acheive low power states (useful in battery powered operation)</p>
                <p>The last few projects introduced me to FIrmware Over The Air (FOTA) and as a result I began configuring my bootloaders (Optiboot) to implement this feature</p>

                <h3>LED Painting</h3>
                <p>This project aimed to explore a more socially oriented design</p>
                <p>The aim was to design a non-intrusive device that would still keep the user updated on important events</p>
                <p>It’s design also helps it serve as a potential assistive device for those impaired of hearing, while being a simple non-intrusive artpiece</p>
                <p>This design encouraged me to explore multiplexing circuits (MAX7219, WS2812), combined with an event driven approach, this would further help conserve power on the device</p>
                <p>Apart from this, I learnt about generative art, and descaling algorithms to use in the design.</p>
                <p>Using a lower spec Arduino Nano helped me realize the  importance of effective programming techniques such as frame buffering, to reduce stutters in the display</p>
                <p>I aim to integrate ESP8266 with this design, adding access to live weather and notification systems to further enhance the assistive functionality.</p>
